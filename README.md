# LibraryManagementSystem
This application, developed using Java Swing, features two user account types: admin and student. The admin holds the authority to manage users (both admin and student), encompassing tasks such as adding, updating, deactivating, and activating users. Furthermore, the admin can oversee the book inventory by adding, updating, and archiving books.

On the student side, users have the capability to request books. The system facilitates this process and incorporates Gmail notifications to keep users informed about their requests.

Underlying the system is an embedded local database, specifically utilizing the H2 database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
